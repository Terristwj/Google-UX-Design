Welcome to the world of wireframes! You'll start by learning how to use research findings to inform ideation during the design process. Next, you'll create two types of storyboards: big picture and close-up. Then, you'll draw your first wireframes, and you'll explore the benefits of wireframing. Keep in mind that at this point in the design process, you should have lots of ideas for designs that address real user needs. You want to refine those ideas, and wireframing can help you do that.
