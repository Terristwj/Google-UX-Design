This is an action-packed part of the course where you'll draw wireframes for a mobile app! First, you'll draw lots of wireframes on paper. Then, you'll transition to digital wireframes in the design tool Figma. You'll even learn directly from Figma about how to best use their tool. Finally, you'll apply Gestalt Principles, like similarity, proximity, and common region, to your wireframes.
