You've gone through the first three stages of the design process: empathize, define, and ideate. Now, you'll enter the fourth stage of the design process: prototype. First, you'll create a paper prototype of your mobile app. Then, you'll transition to a digital low-fidelity prototype in Figma. In addition, you'll explore ways to recognize potential bias in your designs and learn how to avoid deceptive patterns.
