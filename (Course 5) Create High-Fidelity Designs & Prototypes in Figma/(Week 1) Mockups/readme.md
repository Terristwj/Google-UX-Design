Turn your focus to visual design, which is how a product or technology appears to users. In this part of the course, you'll start to create mockups, which are high-fidelity designs that represent a final product. To create mockups, you'll use visual design elements, like typography, color, and iconography. Elements are often arranged into layouts using methods like grids, containment, and negative space. You'll apply all of these visual design learnings to build on the mobile app designs you've been working on throughout the certificate program.
