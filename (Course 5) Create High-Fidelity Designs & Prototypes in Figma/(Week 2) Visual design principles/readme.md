In this part of the course, youâ€™ll use visual design principles to refine mockups. First, you'll use emphasis to guide users to the most important parts of a page. Next, you'll apply hierarchy, scale, and proportion to organize the elements on each page of your app. Then, you'll consider unity and variety to help elements of your app function together or stand out. Finally, you'll revisit Gestalt Principles, like similarity, proximity, and common region, to help users interpret your designs easily.
