Youâ€™re ready to build high-fidelity prototypes in Figma! Following six steps, you'll turn your mockups into a prototype that's ready for testing. In addition, you'll explore two new concepts, gestures and motion, which can help enrich the user experience and increase the usability of prototypes.

### Learning Objectives

- Differentiate between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes
- Recognize accessibility considerations when designing with motion
- Describe how to apply gestures and motion to prototypes in Figma
- Identify common use cases for applying motion to mobile app designs
- Define examples of common gestures used to navigate mobile apps
- Create a high-fidelity prototype from mockup designs in Figma
- Add motion and gestures to enhance prototypes in Figma
