<hr>

Now that you have a high-fidelity prototype, it’s time to test your designs. To get started, you’ll conduct a usability study to test your high-fidelity prototype of a mobile app. You'll analyze the feedback you receive to come up with actionable insights and iterate on your designs. Then, you’ll learn how to hand off designs to engineers for production. Finally, you’ll turn everything you’ve learned about user research, ideation, wireframes, designs, and prototypes into a case study for your professional UX portfolio.
