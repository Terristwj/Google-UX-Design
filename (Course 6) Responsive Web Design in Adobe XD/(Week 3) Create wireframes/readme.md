After you’ve empathized with users, defined the user problem to solve, and begun to ideate possible solutions, it’s time to bring your ideas to life in wireframes. Your responsive website will have different layouts, depending on the device and screen size you’re designing for, so you'll create lots of different wireframes. First, you'll explore common website layouts, and you'll create paper wireframes. Next, you'll get to know a few elements and components that are commonly used in responsive website design. Then, you'll transition to create digital wireframes in Adobe XD. Finally, you’ll update and refine your wireframes to enhance accessibility.
