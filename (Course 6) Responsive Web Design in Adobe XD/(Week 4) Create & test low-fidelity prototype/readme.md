Now that you’ve created digital wireframes in Adobe XD, it’s time to build, test, and iterate on a low-fidelity prototype. First, you'll learn how to build a low-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD. You’ll get feedback about your prototype by planning and conducting a usability study. Then, you'll make changes to your low-fidelity designs based on insights from your research.
