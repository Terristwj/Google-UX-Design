In this part of the course, you'll be ready to create mockups of your responsive website in Adobe XD. You’ll also extend your work with design systems and use components from external design systems in your responsive website designs. Then, you’ll turn your mockups into a high-fidelity prototype by creating connections, adding interaction details, and adjusting animations. Finally, you’ll test your high-fidelity prototype through a usability study, in order to get feedback from a diverse set of users. By the end of this part of the course, your responsive website designs will be complete!
